# Vector-Rat

Vector-Rat is a powerful, efficient, and flexible remote access tool designed to provide an easy-to-use platform for managing and controlling remote devices. Built with scalability and performance in mind, it supports various functionalities for remote control, file management, and system monitoring.

## Features

- **Remote Access**: Gain control of remote machines with ease.
- **File Management**: Transfer files to/from remote machines.
- **System Monitoring**: Track system resources, running processes, and more.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Execute commands and interact with the remote system.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Encryption**: Secure communication between client and server with encryption protocols.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Git**: Install Git to clone the repository.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vector-OS/Vector-Rat.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Vector-Rat
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
python server.py
```

This will launch the server, and it will wait for incoming connections from clients.

### Starting the Client

To start the client, use the following command:

```bash
python client.py
```

Ensure the client connects to the correct server IP address and port.

## Configuration

You can configure various settings in the `config.py` file, such as:

- **Server IP**: The IP address where the server will run.
- **Port**: The port for the server-client connection.
- **Encryption**: Enable or disable encryption for communication.
